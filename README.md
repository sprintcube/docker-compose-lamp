![Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43859895/141092846-905eae39-0169-4fd7-911f-9ff32c48b7e8.png)


A basic LAMP stack environment built using Docker Compose. It consists of the following:

* PHP
* Apache
* MySQL
* phpMyAdmin
* Redis

As of now, we have several different PHP versions. Use appropriate php version as needed:

* 5.4.x
* 5.6.x
* 7.1.x
* 7.2.x
* 7.3.x
* 7.4.x
* 8.0.x
* 8.1.x

 
##  Installation
 
* Clone this repository on your local computer
* configure .env as needed 
* Run the `docker-compose up -d`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp.git
cd docker-compose-lamp/
cp sample.env .env
// modify sample.env as needed
docker-compose up -d
// visit localhost
```

Your LAMP stack is now ready!! You can access it via `http://localhost`. 

##  Configuration and Usage

### General Information 
This Docker Stack is build for local development and not for production usage.

### Configuration
This package comes with default configuration options. You can modify them by creating `.env` file in your root directory.
To make it easy, just copy the content from `sample.env` file and update the environment variable values as per your need.

### Configuration Variables
There are following configuration variables available and you can customize them by overwritting in your own `.env` file.

---
#### PHP
---
_**PHPVERSION**_
Is used to specify which PHP Version you want to use. Defaults always to latest PHP Version. 

_**PHP_INI**_
Define your custom `php.ini` modification to meet your requirments. 

---
#### Apache 
---

_**DOCUMENT_ROOT**_

It is a document root for Apache server. The default value for this is `./www`. All your sites will go here and will be synced automatically.

_**APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT**_

Apache config file value. The default value for this is /var/www/html.

_**VHOSTS_DIR**_

This is for virtual hosts. The default value for this is `./config/vhosts`. You can place your virtual hosts conf files here.

> Make sure you add an entry to your system's `hosts` file for each virtual host.

_**APACHE_LOG_DIR**_

This will be used to store Apache logs. The default value for this is `./logs/apache2`.

---
#### Database
---

> For Apple Silicon Users: 
Please select Mariadb as Database. Oracle doesn't build their SQL Containers for the arm Architecure

_**DATABASE**_

Define which MySQL or MariaDB Version you would like to use. 

_**MYSQL_INITDB_DIR**_

When a container is started for the first time files in this directory with the extensions `.sh`, `.sql`, `.sql.gz` and
`.sql.xz` will be executed in alphabetical order. `.sh` files without file execute permission are sourced rather than executed.
The default value for this is `./config/initdb`.

_**MYSQL_DATA_DIR**_

This is MySQL data directory. The default value for this is `./data/mysql`. All your MySQL data files will be stored here.

_**MYSQL_LOG_DIR**_

This will be used to store Apache logs. The default value for this is `./logs/mysql`.

## Web Server

Apache is configured to run on port 80. So, you can access it via `http://localhost`.

#### Apache Modules

By default following modules are enabled.

* rewrite
* headers

> If you want to enable more modules, just update `./bin/phpX/Dockerfile`. You can also generate a PR and we will merge if seems good for general purpose.
> You have to rebuild the docker image by running `docker-compose build` and restart the docker containers.

#### Connect via SSH

You can connect to web server using `docker-compose exec` command to perform various operation on it. Use below command to login to container via ssh.

```shell
docker-compose exec webserver bash
```

## PHP

The installed version of php depends on your `.env`file.

#### Extensions

By default following extensions are installed. 
May differ for PHP Versions <7.x.x

* mysqli
* pdo_sqlite
* pdo_mysql
* mbstring
* zip
* intl
* mcrypt
* curl
* json
* iconv
* xml
* xmlrpc
* gd

> If you want to install more extension, just update `./bin/webserver/Dockerfile`. You can also generate a PR and we will merge if it seems good for general purpose.
> You have to rebuild the docker image by running `docker-compose build` and restart the docker containers.

## phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is configured to run on port 8080. Use following default credentials.

http://localhost:8080/  
username: root  
password: tiger

## Xdebug

Xdebug comes installed by default and it's version depends on the PHP version chosen in the `".env"` file.

**Xdebug versions:**

PHP <= 7.3: Xdebug 2.X.X

PHP >= 7.4: Xdebug 3.X.X

To use Xdebug you need to enable the settings in the `./config/php/php.ini` file according to the chosen version PHP.

Example:

```
# Xdebug 2
#xdebug.remote_enable=1
#xdebug.remote_autostart=1
#xdebug.remote_connect_back=1
#xdebug.remote_host = host.docker.internal
#xdebug.remote_port=9000

# Xdebug 3
#xdebug.mode=debug
#xdebug.start_with_request=yes
#xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal
#xdebug.client_port=9003
#xdebug.idekey=VSCODE
```

Xdebug VS Code: you have to install the Xdebug extension "PHP Debug". After installed, go to Debug and create the launch file so that your IDE can listen and work properly. 

Example:

**VERY IMPORTANT:** the `pathMappings` depends on how you have opened the folder in VS Code. Each folder has your own configurations launch, that you can view in `.vscode/launch.json`

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            // "port": 9000, // Xdebug 2
            "port": 9003, // Xdebug 3
            "pathMappings": {
                // "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}/www" // if you have opened VSCODE in root folder
                "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}" // if you have opened VSCODE in ./www folder
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Now, make a breakpoint and run debug.

**Tip!** After theses configurations, you may need to restart container.

## Redis

It comes with Redis. It runs on default port `6379`.

## Contributing
We are happy if you want to create a pull request or help people with their issues. If you want to create a PR, please remember that this stack is not built for production usage, and changes should be good for general purpose and not overspecialized. 
> Please note that we simplified the project structure from several branches for each php version, to one centralized master branch.  Please create your PR against master branch. 
> 
Thank you! 

## Why you shouldn't use this stack unmodified in production
We want to empower developers to quickly create creative Applications. Therefore we are providing an easy to set up a local development environment for several different Frameworks and PHP Versions. 
In Production you should modify at a minimum the following subjects:

* php handler: mod_php=> php-fpm
* secure mysql users with proper source IP limitations
