Page components
===============

This directory contains files that define various UI components used throughout the website, such as modals, forms, cards to display items, etc.

These files must only contain the logic code of these components - what data to fetch and how. Each component imports its own HTML template from the `page-parts` directory.

When you need to update the logic, change files in this directory.
