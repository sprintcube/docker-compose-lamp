Page parts
==========

This directory contains various template files for UI components. Each file renders a part of HTML page to be inlined later in bigger pages.

The templates themselves are used by functions defined in `page-components` - these functions govern what data to fetch for display, `page-parts` are about how this data should be inserted into a piece of HTML.
